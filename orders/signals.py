"""Signals for orders app.

There is an intentional bug here for the take-home assignment.

Scenario:
  - A user cancels an order (POST /api/orders/<id>/cancel/)
  - Something unrelated breaks (customer endpoints start returning 404)

Your job as candidate is to find the root cause and fix it safely with tests.
